# Iterative Webdev Introduction Overview

## Overview

### This website discusses optimizing website development costs over the life time of project using Iterative Web Development technology .

### The principle of Iterative Website Development is to develop websites through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental), enabling iterative development teams to independently take advantage of what was learned during development of earlier features or versions of the system.

## Iterative Development 

## Creating and maintaining websites that meet users needs are, complex, difficult, time consuming and expensive 

### Iterative web development teams working together help optimizing website costs and lowering the difficulties creating websites.

### .

### This is done by developers working This on website features, fixes, or testing developers can deploy private Preview Internet websites with their changes, without disturbing other developers work or the website production version enabling stakeholders to monitor progress and quickly give feedback, speeding up the development process. This greatly simplifies traditional software reviews

### The slightest errors during development will require Defect Remediation sometime during the life time of the website. The highest cost over the life time of website projects is remediating defects.Content and software defects cost less when found early during development

### Content and software defects cost less when found early during development.

# Distributed Version Control

## git

### Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files, allowing multiple users to collaborate on software projects. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is primarily developed on Linux, although it supports most major operating systems including Windows, macOS, and BSDs.  
  Each Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.Some frequently used Git commands include:  
  git init: Create a new Git repository  
  git clone [URL]: Clone an existing repository from a URL  
  git add [file]: Add a file to the staging area  
  git commit -m "[message]": Commit staged changes with a message  
  git push: Upload local commits to a remote repository  
  git pull: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository

## GitHub

### GitHub facilitates collaboration by allowing developers to fork repositories, submit pull requests, and review each other's code. It also supports features like issues, milestones, and project boards to organize and track work.

## Complete project history 

### Who changes
- What
- when
- where
- why

## Single project Repository

### Team Members
- make changes only to their forked copy  of their project repo 
- change request

### Repository guardian 
- Pull Request from team members to possibly make changes to project repo
- alerts other team members 
- interested team members can  Fetch to update their repo with proposed changes
- proposed changes and discussed
- Guardian works with interested team members

## Define Team Documents

### **Prerequisites**Defining website prerequisites is the first steps in optimizing website costs Defining websites helps teams and Stakeholders understand the project.

### Purpose

### Funding

### Functionality

### Stakeholders

### Content

### The **Musts** and **Wants** features

## Design Team Documents

### **Prerequisites** 
- Decisions about Website Design
- Consistency
- Theme
- Color Scheme
- Typology
- Navigation

### User Interaction
- The core foundations of a user's website experience are:
- **Fast** - Website responds quickly to user interactions with smooth scrolling.
- **Integrated -** The website uses the full capabilities of the user device to create an experience true to the device**.**
- The website uses the **full capabilities** of the user device to create an experience true to the device
- **Reliable** - Loads quickly and reliably even in uncertain network conditions.
- **Engaging** - Keeps user coming back to a website

## Develop Team Documents

### **Prerequisites**
- Decisions about resources required to transform the Define and Design work into a website and infrastructure
- Decisions about static site generator and programming tools

### Translates the *Define* and *Design* teams processes into website pages

### Uses development languages to create website material such as text, graphics, and abstract logical structures. These languages are nonhuman, and strict

### Configures and uses website development tools
