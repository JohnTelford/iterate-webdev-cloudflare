## Overview

This website discusses optimizing website development costs over the life time of project using Iterative Web Development technology .

The principle of Iterative Website Development is to develop websites through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental), enabling iterative development teams to independently take advantage of what was learned during development of earlier features or versions of the system.

## Iterate Web Development

Creating and maintaining websites that meet users needs are, complex, difficult, time consuming and expensive.

Iterative web development teams working together help optimizing website costs and lowering the difficulties creating websites.

This is done by all team members working on website features, fixes, or testing at the same time. Team members can deploy private Preview Internet websites with their changes, without disturbing other team members work or the website production version. This enabling stakeholders to monitor progress and quickly give feedback, speeding up the development process. This greatly simplifies traditional software reviews.

# Defect Remediation Costs
The slightest errors during development will require Defect Remediation sometime during the life time of the website. The highest cost over the life time of website projects is remediating defects.  The highest cost over the life time of website projects is remediating defects.

Content and software defects cost less when found early
